1. SSH into the robot
> ssh jetbot@[ip of robot]
    > password = jetbot
    
2. Goto the docker directory
> cd ~/jetbot/docker

3. Stop the docker container
> ./disable.sh
    > password = jetbot
    > this will take a while, wait for command to complete
    > ignore any warning about jetbot_camera

4. Edit the Jupyter docker container's configurations
> vi ~/jetbot/docker/juypter/enable.sh
    > press 'a' or 'i' to enter edit mode
    > goto line -p 8888:8888 \
    > add these lines after the -p 8888:8888 \ line
        >   --dns 130.216.1.0 \
            --dns 130.216.1.1 \
            --dns 8.8.8.8 \
            --dns 8.8.4.4 \
    > repeat in the 'else' section, where another -p 8888:8888 \ line exists
    > press 'escape' to exit editing mode
    > press ':' to enter menu
    > type 'wq!' and press enter to "write, quit, force"
  
5. Go back to docker folder
> cd ~/jetbot/docker

6. Restart the docker containers
> ./enable.sh
    > password = jetbot
    > wait for the command to complete operation
